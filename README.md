# 🤝 Moai Friends

A sleek, modern 1-on-1 friend-matching app where AI guides meaningful connections through thoughtful onboarding, intake, and weekly introductions.

## 🎯 Vision

**Purpose**: Help people make new friends nearby, not romantic partners.

**Model**: 
- **Home = AI chat** — handles onboarding, intake, and weekly matches
- **Weekly cadence** — every Sunday at noon (local), AI drops up to 3 curated matches
- **Consent-first** — only if both users tap "Yes" → a triad chat opens (me, them, AI)
- **AI warms conversations** with icebreakers and meetup suggestions, then steps back

## 📱 App Structure

### iOS Tabs (3 total):

1. **🤖 AI Agent (Home)** — chat with AI; intake and weekly matches happen here
2. **💬 Moai Matches (Chats)** — list of ongoing triad conversations  
3. **👤 Profile** — edit info, availability, reminders, pause, safety link

## 🎨 Design & UX

- **Dark theme**: `#0A0B0D` background, `#7C6CFF` accent
- **Typography**: Inter Tight for headers, Inter for body
- **Controls**: chip buttons, Likert sliders, short text, availability grid
- **Animations**: subtle typing indicator, 400–600ms micro-delays
- **Tone**: warm, brief, platonic. Always offer "Skip"

## 🔄 User Flows

### 1. Onboarding (with location detection)
- User signs up (email/phone, 18+)
- App detects device location (GPS/OS permission)
- Reverse-geocode into city + coordinates
- Show confirmation: "I found you're in [City]. Use this as your starting point?"
- User sets travel radius (default 10–25 km, adjustable)
- User adds avatar + name/initial
- Redirect immediately into AI chat to begin intake

### 2. Intake (AI chat, 50 questions)
- AI guide asks all 50 questions conversationally, one at a time
- Inputs: chips, Likert scales, text fields, availability grid
- Progress recap every ~6 Qs
- Autosave answers; allow pause/resume
- End: "All done! I'll use this to find your 3 weekly intros. They'll show up here every Sunday."

### 3. Weekly Matches (delivered in Home chat)
- Sunday at noon (local), AI posts: "Your 3 friend intros for the week are ready. Here's the first…"
- Each intro = inline card with avatar, overlaps, bio snippet, complementary difference
- Buttons: Yes, introduce us / Not now
- If Yes: AI replies "Got it — I'll check with them."
- If both Yes: AI says "Great! You both said yes. I'll open a chat in Moai Matches." → triad chat created

### 4. Triad Chats (Moai Matches tab)
- AI opener: points out overlaps, one difference, suggests 2 icebreakers + meetup options
- AI steps back after warmup; nudges if idle 24h
- Overflow actions: Report / Block / Leave. Block ends chat + suppresses resurfacing

### 5. Weekly Cycle
- Matches expire Saturday midnight if untouched
- New batch drops Sunday noon
- Prevent repeats within 8 weeks (unless profile changed)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native + Expo
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth + Database + Real-time)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6
- **Styling**: React Native StyleSheet with custom theme system
- **Location**: Expo Location
- **Images**: Expo Image Picker

## 📊 Database Schema

### Core Tables:
- `profiles` - User profiles with location and basic info
- `preferences` - User preferences and settings
- `intake_responses` - 50-question intake responses with embeddings
- `match_candidates` - Weekly match candidates with scores
- `consents` - User consent responses to matches
- `conversations` - Triad conversations between users
- `messages` - Messages in conversations
- `blocks` - User blocks
- `reports` - User reports

### Scoring Algorithm:
- Filters: blocks, distance, language
- Score = traits cosine + hobbies Jaccard + bio embedding cosine + availability Jaccard + life_stage overlap – distance penalty
- Weekly batch: pick top ≤3, exclude last-8-week repeats

## 🤖 AI Host Role

- Greets, runs intake in chat
- Drops weekly intros as inline cards
- Confirms Yes/No; opens triad chat on mutual Yes
- Triad opener: overlaps, complement, icebreakers, meetup suggestion
- Nudges idle after 24h
- Reinforces safety (public spaces, share info later, easy block/report)

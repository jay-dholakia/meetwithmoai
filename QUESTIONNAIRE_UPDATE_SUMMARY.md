## Benefits of New Structure

### üöÄ Performance
- **Direct column queries** instead of JSONB queries
- **Better indexing** for faster matching
- **Reduced storage** with structured data

### üîç Queryability
- **Easy filtering** by specific criteria
- **Better analytics** on individual questions
- **Improved matching algorithm** performance

### üõ°Ô∏è Type Safety
- **Structured data types** prevent errors
- **Better validation** with constraints
- **Easier debugging** and maintenance

## Next Steps

1. **Test the new questionnaire** in the app
2. **Run migration** if you have existing data: `npm run migrate:intake`
3. **Update matching algorithm** to use new structured fields
4. **Monitor performance** improvements

## Database Schema

The new `intake_responses_v2` table includes:
- **35 structured columns** for each question
- **Proper constraints** for data validation
- **GIN indexes** for array fields
- **Foreign key relationships** to profiles table
- **RLS policies** for security

## Migration Path

If you have existing data in the old `intake_responses` table:
1. Run: `npm run migrate:intake`
2. This will convert old JSONB data to new structured format
3. Old table can be kept for backup or removed later

The new structure is much more efficient and will provide better user experience and matching quality!
